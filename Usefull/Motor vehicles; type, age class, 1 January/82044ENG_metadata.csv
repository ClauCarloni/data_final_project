This table contains key data on the vehicle fleet of passenger cars, motorcycles and commercial vehicles (by vehicle category) and by age class of the vehicle.
The figures are based on the registration numbers provided by the Dutch Road Traffic Authority (RDW). All vehicles registered on 1 January of each year have been counted, the data are recorded and stored and the register can be accessed for statistical purposes.
As from 2004, the total count of vehicles is not fully comparable with previous years due to separate registration of trailers and semi-trailers.

Data available from: 2000

Status of the figures: final

Changes as of 22 September 2021
Figures of the vehicle fleet on 1 January 2021 have been added.

The figures for 1 January 2021 have been published with a delay this year due to problems with the distribution of the source files. Furthermore, after receiving the source files, extensive analyses revealed that in the current selection too many vehicles are included. This concerns vehicles with no insurance during the year prior to the reference date. To give an indication, this comprises approximately 2 percent of all motor vehicles, with percentages differing per vehicle category. We are currently working on a report, in which we will describe and quantify the differences between the current method and the selection method we will use in the future. This report will be published later this year. The figures in this table have been calculated using the current method. This means that the data on 1 January 2021 are comparable with the data of previous years. 

When will new figures be published?
New figures of the vehicle fleet on 1 January 2022 will be published in February 2022.
