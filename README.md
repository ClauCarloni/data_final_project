# data_final_project

This project aims to use a selection from learned techniques during the course to build up an end to end data analysis project suitable for the market. 

The proper design of this project will be defined based on the features of the available data set.

Besides that, the idea is to work with a theme that is on demand at the data analysts/scientists work market as "renewables & environment", "product analysis", "internet", "retail".

Within the mentioned topics the energetic sector draws attention as the demand for energy is growing all around the world and together comes the responsability with the environmental impacts related to this consumption raise.

"The United Nations Climate Change Conference is an important event that brings together leaders from all countries in the world to agree on how to intensify global action to resolve the climate crisis."

After the Paris COP21 in 2015 (when the last goals were defined) we are about to have the COP26 next November. "At the meeting, the parties will review progress made on the commitments made under the Paris Agreement objective, which is to keep global warming well below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels and make efforts to limit it. at 1.5 °C."
Therefore, we are about to have new definitions regarding our obligations towards "renewables & environment" what puts this them at the spotlight making even more important to have a good analysis about the what we have, what are our target, and how can we achieve it.
